**Executive Summary**

In this study, the key factors associated to thyroid cancer recurrence were identified through the data of 383 thyroid cancer patients. Factors strongly linked to recurrence include the male gender, smoking history, advanced TNM stages, high risk classification, having poor treatment responses, and certain pathological subtypes. Evaluated predictive models—particularly the Random Forest and XGBoost model—were able to achieve high levels of accuracy, allowing for risk assessing patient-specific recurrence cases. With the user-facing functionality, it enables users to input patient data and interact with the study's best performing predictive model, the Random Forest model. These findings support strategies such as early intervention and targeted monitoring in the thyroid cancer field.
